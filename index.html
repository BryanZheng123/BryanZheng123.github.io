          The gameâ€™s two main modes are Survival and Creative. In Survival,
          players must find their own building supplies and food. They also
          interact with blocklike mobs, or moving creatures. (Creepers and
          zombies are some of the dangerous ones.) In Creative mode, players
          are given unlimited amount of supplies to build and do whatever they
          desire to. They also do not have to eat to survive. They also can
          break all kinds of blocks immediately. The purpose of the game is
          simply to build and explore (and survive). You can play by yourself
          or you can play online with others. The smartphone and tablet
          versions offer multi-player options through WiFi networks. Players
          can connect to thousands of Minecraft online games (servers), some
          of which involve battling other players.
